**AI-Powered Telegram Bot** 

## About
As a daily user of Telegram, I find it to be a convenient app for messaging, chatting, reading news, and more. Additionally, I use ChatGPT daily, and I thought it would be cool to have ChatGPT in Telegram so I could text it like a friend without switching to a browser or another app.
